===================
Built at HackMIT, a hardware/software integrated parking assistant. Spot is a new way to easily find parking using Arduino-based hardware that detects the presence of a car in a given parking spot and pushes that data on a Flask mobile web app.

I was mostly responsible for working on the front end side of the project including working intimately with the Google Maps API.
